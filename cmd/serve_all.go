var allCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "all",
	Short: "Serves both public and administrative HTTP/2 APIs",
	Long: `Starts a process which listens on two ports for public and administrative HTTP/2 API requests.

If you want more granular control (e.g. different TLS settings) over each API group (administrative, public) you
can run "serve admin" and "serve public" separately.

This command exposes a variety of controls via environment variables. You can
set environments using "export KEY=VALUE" (Linux/macOS) or "set KEY=VALUE" (Windows). On Linux,
you can also set environments by prepending key value pairs: "KEY=VALUE KEY2=VALUE2 hydra"

All possible controls are listed below. This command exposes exposes command line flags, which are listed below
the controls section.

` + serveControls,
	Run: server.RunServeAll(Version, Commit, Date),
}

func init() {
	serveCmd.AddCommand(allCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// allCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// allCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
